Odin is a forge mod for Hypixel Skyblock on the minecraft version 1.8.9 

The mod contains two versions which are two separate builds. Utilizing Gradle MultiProject functionality enables us to develop both versions within the same repository while still developing two different versions. If you have any questions regarding the mod, please feel free to ask in the Discord server.
